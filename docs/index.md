# BLE-enabled HID based on Edge Inference Accelerated Handwriting Recognition
# Abstract

Image recognition is an emerging field with varieties of applications spanning from disease diagnosis, facial recognition, monitoring systems, to simply entertainment and human machine interface. Years ago, machine learning algorithms were computation-demanding, which is a major roadblock for the delivery of image recognition service with lower-cost and low-power embedded system. As the performance, robustness, and the resource-efficient techniques for machine learnings have been significantly improved over the years, the application of low-cost and high-performance device for human-device interaction becomes possible.

The purpose of this project is to build a low-cost, small-size and low-power real-time handwritten character recognition system based on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with a touch screen, which is capable of offering handwriting input experience in real-time and send recognized characters to BLE-enabled terminal equipment as keyboard strokes. Inference of character recognition model is done on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to enable the compatibility to any BLE-enabled devices.
