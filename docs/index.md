# Abstract

Image recognition is an emerging field with varieties of applications spanning from disease diagnosis, facial recognition, monitoring systems, to simply entertainment and human machine interface. Years ago, machine learning algorithms were computation-demanding, which is a major roadblock for the delivery of image recognition service with lower-cost and low-power embedded system. As the performance, robustness, and the resouce-efficent techniques for machine learnings have been significantly improved over the years, the application of low-cost and high-performance device for human-device interaction becomes possible.

The purpose of this project is to build a small-size and low-power real-time optical character recognition system based on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and a touch screen, which is capable of recognizing characters written on the touch screen in real-time and send recognized characters to BLE enabled laptop/desktop as keyboard strokes. Inference of written characters is done on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to enable the extendability of the whole system where recognized written characters are not limited to be used as keyboard strokes but rather any BLE-enable external devices.
